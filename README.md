# EAPoseNet:Efficient Animal Pose Network in Limited Computing Power Scenarios

Abstract:Accurate and efficient estimation of animal poses is crucial across various
fields, such as animal behavior research, pharmaceutical studies, and biomimetic
robotics. However, pose estimation typically relies on complex models to
achieve higher detection precision. When computational resources are limited,
achieving real-time detection with high parametric calculations becomes challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight animal pose estimation
model (EAPoseNet) to address the need for real-time detection in resourceconstrained scenarios.
